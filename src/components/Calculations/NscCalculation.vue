          <h2>Explanation</h2>
          <p>
            The National Savings Certificate (NSC) is a safe and government-backed savings
            scheme in Indiaüîê, encouraging people to save money. The scheme is open only
            for individual Indian residents and offers nomination facility as well. It
            offers a fixed interest rate of 7.7% per year currently, with a minimum
            investment requirement of ‚Çπ.1,000. The lock-in period is 5 years‚åö for the NSC
            scheme, and investors can get tax benefits up to ‚Çπ.1.5 lakh under Section 80C
            of the Income Tax Act. Use the post office NSC calculator here for better
            estimation‚úÖ.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            HUFs, trusts, NRIs, and companies ‚Äì we hate to break it to you, but NSC is for
            individuals only. The rest of you, sit this one out!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            NSC returns calculatorüßÆ provides a definite answer to how much you will get
            out of your NSC. It can be used as collateral for loans. While it offers a
            fixed income, it may not beat inflation. Tax benefits apply to the invested
            amount ( up to ‚Çπ.1.5 lakh under Section 80C) and there is no TDS on interest.
            Since for the first 4 years, interest is reinvested into the NSC, it is not
            taxed (upto ‚Çπ1.5 lac.) The interest earned in the fifth year however is
            taxable according to the investor's slab rateüí∞.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            You can invest in NSC electronicallyüíª or through authorized banksüè¶ and post
            offices. Documents necessary to invest in NSC include identity and address
            proofs with a photograph.üìëüìπ
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In summary, NSC is a secure investment suitable for those who prefer stable
            returns and want to save on taxes. Although it may not offer high returns, its
            government support and guaranteed interest make it an appealing choice for
            risk-averse individuals.‚úÖüí∞
